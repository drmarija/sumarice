        <h2>Kragujevac - Šumarice</h2>
        <p>
          The Memorial park October in Kragujevac was established in 1953 on
          site where in October 1941 a few thousand citizens from Kragujevac
          were shot – Serbs, Jews, Roma people, Muslims, Macedonians, Slovenians
          and members of other nationalities. This terrible crime was committed
          in Kragujevac and the surrounding villages, over the male population
          aged between twelve and sixty five. The Memorial park takes up the
          area of 352 ha where there are 30 mass tombs. The area has been laid
          out by the urban project of two architects Mihailo Mitrovic and
          Radivoje Tomiæ. Up till today over ten tombs there are ten
          sculptural-architectonic unities. One of them, the Monument to the
          shot pupils and teachers is a true symbol of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Museum 21st October was founded within the Memorial park on 15th
          February 1976 with the aim of gathering, processing, keeping and
          presenting the documents concerning the shooting and the victims,
          through exhibitions and printed material. Apart from that, The
          Memorial Park organizes the traditional manifestations, whereas the
          exhibitions the modern art exhibitions are organized in the City
          gallery The Balkan Bridges, opened on 7th April 2005.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every year since 1971 the central manifestation of paying tribute has
          been held next to the Monument of shot pupils and teachers by the name
          of The Great School Lesson. Original works with peaceful messages,
          made by renowned domestic and foreign authors and composers are chosen
          for the occasion, and among the performers there are most famous
          actors, opera soloists and choirs.
        </p>

          The Memorial Park was declared the cultural heritage of extreme
          importance on 27th December 1979. The October in Kragujevac Memorial
          Park`s mission is to nurture and keep the memory of this tragic event;
          to raise the awareness and educate the coming generations so that such
          a crime is never repeated again.
