          <h2>A Bloody Fairy-Tale</h2>
          <p>
            The poem “Krvava Bajka”, or “A Bloody Fairytale”, by Desanka
            Maksimovich, is an excellent illustration of how a historical
            incident like the Kragujevac tragedy can be commemorated
            apolitically. This poem focuses on the human tragedy itself and it
            speaks volumes without making a political statement, not even a
            subtle one. An understanding of the political and military intrigues
            in the Balkans during the Second World War is absolutely unnecessary
            to capture the essence of this poem. It chronicles the senseless and
            brutal deaths of hundreds of schoolchildren in the evocative, true
            language of poetry. “A Bloody Fairytale” is free of political agenda
            by its very subject: it speaks of the premature end of young lives,
            employing imagery from everyday life to vividly express the utter
            sadness of the Kragujevac massacre. The language is simple, the
            message straightforward. It is a classic lamentation, grief at its
            most basic level, packaged in flowing verses. The dramatic framework
            of the poem “A Bloody Fairytale” is the element that makes it an
            exceptional poem. In this case, the event is the not the usual death
            by accident, ill health or old age. This poem memorializes the
            deaths of hundreds of schoolchildren, who were selected, with
            incomprehensible malice, especially because they were children and
            their deaths would punctuate more fully the German call to end
            resistance. Despite the apolitical bearings of “A Bloody Fairytale”,
            it became a standard part of the middle school curriculum of schools
            in Yugoslavia. It was first published as part of a series meant for
            use in the seventh grade. The poem gained a new dimension with its
            introduction into the school curriculum. Every schoolchild learned
            of Kragujevac in conjunction with this poem and this further
            solidified the consensus that, though the victims were almost
            exclusively Serbian, it was a national tragedy for Yugoslavia. The
            author wanted to give the world a lamentation for the young lives
            lost at Kragujevac in 1941.
