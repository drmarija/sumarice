# A Bloody Fairy-Tale 

This is my first project and it is dedicated to myself (10 years of war zone) but also to current war in Ukraine. The idea behind the project is to remind all of us that war brings nothing good and that we as human kind are all fragile and temporarily on the planet. The approach to idea was to be presented in the style of the book ("fairytale") like parents read to children. Each page is different and has a symbol behind it.

   * I tested that pages work in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera.

   * I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and function on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.

   * I confirmed that the navigation bar, title, introduction and poem texts are all readable and easy to understand.

   * I have confirmed that all the links function and open webpages in the new tab.

## Bugs

### Unsolved bug

    * When I tested pages on smaller screens (under 800px), it showed that navbar is jumping. 

    * I discovered that was caused by the padding added to the navbar.

    * Removing the padding solved the problem but then the navbar was too close to the top of the screen.
